   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Flan has been a staple of Mexican and Latin American cuisine since Spaniards brought it to Mexico during the Spanish occupation.</p>
   <p>A small slice of this impressively rich, creamy, caramel flan dessert goes a long way!</p>
  
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>5 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    
</ul> 
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In a heavy saucepan, cook sugar and water over medium-low heat until melted and golden, about 15 minutes. Brush down crystals on the side of the pan with additional water as necessary.</li>
  <li>Quickly pour into an ungreased 2-qt. round baking or souffle dish, tilting to coat the bottom; let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until thoroughly combined. Add remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour over caramelized sugar.</li>
  <li>Place the dish in a larger baking pan. Pour boiling water into larger pan to a depth of 1 in. Bake until the center is just set (mixture will jiggle), 50-60 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove dish from a larger pan to a wire rack; cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate overnight. </li>
  <li>To unmold, run a knife around edge and invert onto a large rimmed serving platter. Cut into wedges or spoon onto dessert plates; spoon sauce over each serving.</li>
