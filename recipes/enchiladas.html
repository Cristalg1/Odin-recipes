<h2>Description</h2>
   <p>These chicken enchiladas have been one of my go-to recipes for years and are always a hit when we serve them to friends and family.</p>

<h3>Ingredients for the Chicken</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3 boneless chicken breasts (about 2½ pounds)</li>
  <li>5 cups water</li>
  <li>salt to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
<h3>Ingredients for the Sause</h3>
<li>6 ancho chiles stems and seeds removed</li>
<li>4 New Mexico peppers or guajillo chiles, stems and seeds removed</li>
<li>4 chile de arbol peppers optional</li>
<li>2 Roma tomatoes halved</li>
<li>1/2 white onion quartered</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1/2 a cup of water to cover</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon oregano, slat and pepper to taste</li>
<li>3 1/2-4 cups chicken broth from poaching the chicken</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps for the chicken</h3>
<ol> 
   <li>Add the chicken to a saucepan and cover with 5 cups of water.</li>
   <li>Season with salt, bring to a boil, reduce heat and poach for 45 to 50 minutes or until tende</li>
   <li>Remove chicken and shred while still warm, cover and set aside. Strain the broth and reserve for making enchilada sauce.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Steps for the Sauce</h4>
<ol>
   <li>Combine the dried chiles, tomato, onion and garlic in a medium saucepan. Cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook until tomatoes are tender and peppers are soft. Drain all of the cooking liquid and transfer to blender.</li>
   <li>Add cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, pepper and about 2 cups of reserved chicken broth. Blend on high until smooth and taste for salt. Strain the sauce through a wire strainer and pour the remaining 1½ cups of chicken broth through to help strain. Transfer sauce back to pan and heat to a simmer. Whisk the masa harina into the 1/3 cup of water until smooth. Whisk this into the simmering sauce until well combined. Cook for 5 more minutes, then keep warm on low.</li>
   <li>In a bowl, combine the shredded chicken breast with ½ cup of enchilada sauce, stir well to combine. Now you're ready to start building your enchiladas!</li>
   <li>Take one tortilla and fill with about 2 tablespoons of chicken, and roll shut to resemble a flute.</li>
   <li>Lay the enchiladas in the baking pan with the sauce already in it. Once you have filled and rolled them all, top with the remaining sauce and both cheeses. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Garnish and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
   </ol>
